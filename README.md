<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started



### Prerequisites
- You must know the location and have access to the Plex Plug-Ins folder. If you need help finding it go [here](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201106098-how-do-i-find-the-plug-ins-folder/)
- You need to have a basic understanding of how to download from git and unzip files to your OS.
- You should have obtained an API Token from [ThePornDB](https://theporndb.net/)

### Installation
- Download, unzip, and rename the Plug-In. If you need help follow [these](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201187656-how-do-i-manually-install-a-plugin/) instructions
- The Plug-In can be found at: ``` https://github.com/ThePornDatabase/ThePornDB.bundle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip ```
- Please note that the Plug-In/Archive that you download will have two .bundle directories included, one for 'Scenes' and one for 'Movies'
  Either or both of these will need to be placed into your Plex Plug-In folder, not folder that houses them




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Create a Movie Library (one library for Movies and another for Scenes is recommended)
- Add the folders that contain your associated adult media
- Select ThePornDB Agent in the advanced tab
- Input your API Token in the Personal API Key box
- Select any other options and save your changes

> For a successful match to your Scenes, filenames should be in the format Site YYYY-MM-DD Title (The date is the most important part)
> For matching movies, try to limit filename as much as possible to the actual name of the movie.  Remove any 'release tags' as much as possible
